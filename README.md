## I'm Michael Irigoyen
I am a software engineer who has been working in the industry for over fifteen years. I enjoy music, gaming, iconography, and home improvement projects. I love to continuously learn new things, and I find expanding my knowledge base often comes while helping others do the same. One of my passions is the Extra Life fundraiser, which raises money for kids in Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.

## Material Design Icons
My biggest open-source hobby is working with [Templarian](https://github.com/Templarian), and the rest of the core contributor team, on [Material Design Icons](https://www.materialdesignicons.com). We create, and assistant those who also wish to create, icons that follow [Material guidelines](https://material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html#design-principles) that anyone can use in their applications.

## Philanthropy
I am a big advocate for [Extra Life](https://www.extra-life.org/participant/goyney), a gaming charity that raises money for children in Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. In fact, I have even written a [Extra Life API wrapper for JavaScript](https://github.com/goyney/extra-life)! If you come across this page and I have helped you in a some way, or you are just feeling generous, [please consider donating #ForTheKids](https://www.extra-life.org/participant/goyney).

## Sponsor
I do have a GitHub Sponsor page. However, if you feel you wish to support what I do, please consider donating to Extra Life from the link above. If you really like me, feel free to [sponsor me as well](https://github.com/sponsors/goyney). I appreciate your support!
