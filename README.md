## Welcome!
Hello! I'm Michael and I write code for a living. I am currently employeed as a Senior Software Engineer II with [Accusoft](https://www.accusoft.com) in Tampa, FL. I work all across our tech stack, including managing resources in AWS, deploying with Docker, writing and testing Node.js microservices, and building front-ends in React. I am very passionate about User Experience, whether that be in the UI or the API. I also enjoy contributing to the open-source community whenever I find a useful avenue to do so.

## Presentations
If you've seen me talk at a past conference and are looking for the slide decks, see my [Presentations](https://github.com/goyney/presentations) repository.

## Material Design Icons
My biggest open-source hobby is working with [Templarian](https://github.com/Templarian), and the rest of the core contributor team, on [Material Design Icons](https://www.materialdesignicons.com). We create, and assistant those who also wish to create, icons that follow [Material guidelines](https://material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html#design-principles) that anyone can use in their applications.

## Philanthropy
I am a big advocate for [Extra Life](https://www.extra-life.org/participant/goyney), a gaming charity that raises money for children in Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. In fact, I have even written a [Extra Life API wrapper for JavaScript](https://github.com/goyney/extra-life)! If you come across this page and I have helped you in a some way, or you are just feeling generous, [please consider donating #ForTheKids](https://www.extra-life.org/participant/goyney).

## Sponsor
I do have a GitHub Sponsor page. However, if you feel you wish to support what I do, please consider donating to Extra Life from the link above. If you really like me, feel free to [sponsor me as well](https://github.com/sponsors/goyney). I appreciate your support!
