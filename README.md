# I'm Michael Irigoyen
I am a software engineer who has been working in the industry for over fifteen years. I enjoy music, gaming, iconography, and home improvement projects. I love to continuously learn new things, and I find expanding my knowledge base often comes while helping others do the same. One of my passions is the Extra Life fundraiser, which raises money for kids in Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.

## Pictogrammers
[Pictogrammers](https://github.com/Pictogrammers) is an open-source community developing high-quality icons for use by designers and developers in web and application development. As a core contributor, I help maintain our icon databases, [field issues on GitHub](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/issues), assist in creation and maintenance of our supporting websites, and have personally contributed more than 1000 icons to our [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) library!

## Talks
I love speaking at conferences, meetups, and more. You can find archives of my past presentations in my [talks repository](https://github.com/goyney/talks).

## Philanthropy
For the past eight years, I have been participating in the [Extra Life fundraiser](https://www.extra-life.org/). Extra Life works to save local kids through the power of gaming, and 100% of all donations go directly to Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. Over the past four years, I have lead the [Accusoft Team](https://www.accusoft.com/extralife) and we have raised over $30,000!

I have been a huge advocate for Extra Life over the years, because I believe so strongly in its goal: to give hope to children who are confronting scary things no child should have to face. Besides leading Accusoft's team, I have also:

- Created an [NPM module wrapping the Extra Life API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extra-life), allowing fundraisers to build interactive applications to help them in their fundraising goals.

- [Given a presentation](https://github.com/goyney/talks/tree/main/1UP%20-%20Empowering%20Communities%20with%20APIs) about the creation of that NPM module at API: World 2019.

If I have ever helped you in the past, and you are looking for a way to give back or if you are just feeling generous, [please consider donating to this amazing cause](https://www.extra-life.org/participant/goyney)! #ForTheKids
